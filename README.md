### Profile: [https://galsang.github.io/](https://galsang.github.io/)

### Research Interests

#### Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning & Deep Learning. Especially interested in

- Lexical/sentence-level semantics (e.g., representation learning, language models)
- Adopting/inducing linguistic knowledge to/from neural networks (e.g., unsupervised parsing)
- Interpretation and analysis of NLP models
- Multilingual NLP including one for Korean
